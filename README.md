## Step 2

1. Learn about homebrew and install it following the instructions here: https://brew.sh/
2. Install JDK 9 using homebrew (use the `brew` command)
3. We will use the `sublime` editor for writing code. Install `sublime text` using `brew` by following the instructions here: https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/sublime-text
4. Code, compile and run
  - Create a directory named  `step-1` under `~\2023\semester-one\intro-to-programming`
  - Write a program to print `Hello, World` to the console using the sublime editor and save it in the above directory
  - Compile and run the saved program using `javac` and `java` tools respectively
5. Write the following programs:
  - Print the remainder of dividing two decimal numbers
  - To convert the temperature in Centigrade to Fahrenheit
  - Find the area of a triangle whose three sides are given (Read this article on how to read input from user https://bushansirgur.in/example-to-read-the-user-input-using-scanner-class/)
