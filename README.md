## Step 1

1. Using search
    - List files in a directory
    - Create a directory structure
    - Save the syllabus for semester one into the semester one directory
2. Using ChatGPT and Bard
    - Find the size of each file in the semester directory
    - Copy the semester one file to the semester two directory
    - Delete files from the semester two directory
    - Find the command to go to the home directory
3. Read this article: https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-use-the-command-line-for-apple-macos-and-linux/
4. https://github.com/0nn0/terminal-mac-cheatsheet#english-version
5. Gist: https://github.com/yaravind/dev-tools#home

## Step 2

1. Learn about homebrew and install it following the instructions here: https://brew.sh/
2. Install JDK 11 using homebrew (use the `brew` command: https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/zulu#default)
3. We will use the `sublime` editor for writing code. Install `sublime text` using `brew` by following the instructions here: https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/sublime-text
4. Code, compile, and run
    - Create a directory called `unit-1` under `~\2023\semester-one\intro-to-programming`
    - Write a program to print `Hello, World` to the console using the sublime editor and save it in the above directory
    - Compile and run the saved program using `javac` and `java` tools respectively
5. Write the following programs:
    - Print the remainder of dividing two decimal numbers
    - To convert the temperature in Centigrade to Fahrenheit `°C = (°F − 32) x 5/9`
    - Find out the average of numbers between 5 and 100
    - check whether the given integer is a multiple of both 5 and 7
6. Register at https://hyperskill.org/ and select the **Introduction to Java** track

## Step 3

1. Read the tutorials in sequence until **The main method** topic from https://hyperskill.org/. Complete the practice exercises for each topic. THis will cover everything of **Unit 1** of your college course except **Graphics**.
2. How to read user input? Read the `Java Input` section of this article: https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/basic-input-output
3. Complete this project from hyperskill: **Simple Chatty Bot** - https://github.com/AdamJeddy/Simple-Java-ChatBot OR
   - Write a program that asks the user for their name and greets them with their name.
   - Modify the previous program such that only the users Alice and Bob are greeted with their names.
4. Read about Graphics/Swing: https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/5514

## Step 4

1. Error and Exception handling in Java
2. Learn a **version control** to save the history of your work. We will use `Git`: https://blog.legalhub.cn/git-guide/index.html
3. File input and output: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/streams.html

## Step 5

1. Data Structures
    - Arrays
    - Lists
    - Maps
    - Sets
    - Trees
3. Algorithms: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-algorithms/
    - Search
    - Sort
